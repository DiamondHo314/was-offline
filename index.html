                <p>The teacher in this gif is a woman of words.
                    She is the grapest of the grape. Pakistan is a country to 
                    sacrifice life for. Her school is the future of pakistani 
                    pilots and cricketers, and their sole motive is such
                    grape, grape motive. No other insitution can ever imagine
                    to compete with this woman's INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF PAKISTAN.
                    Well the grape motive previously talked about is, to, 
                    defeat INDIA. India will be defeated destroyed by the future
                    soldiers from INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF PAKISTAN. India will be 
                    defeated so bad they will be forced to retreat from the battleground
                    making pakistan have the easiest victory. The victory shall be grape.
                    India will be destroyed by pakistani cricketers and PILOTS.
                    So, remember, you must, SACRIFICE YOUR OWN LIFE FOR PAKISTAN!
